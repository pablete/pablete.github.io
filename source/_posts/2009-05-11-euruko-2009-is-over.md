Euruko 2009 conference in Barcelona, Spain was excelent! The venue was really good. Everything was very well organized by the great people of the SRUG.

My favorite talks were:

* Javier Ramirez with [Fun with ruby (and without r***s) Program your own games with gosu](http://2009.euruko.org/talks/9-fun-with-ruby-and-without-r-s-program-your-own-games-with-gosu/index.html)
* Joshua Sierles with [Automate Everything: Cooking with Chef](http://2009.euruko.org/talks/12-chef-the-new-ruby-system-management-tool/index.html)
* Aslak Helles√∏y with [Quality code with Cucumber](http://2009.euruko.org/talks/22-quality-code-with-cucumber/index.html)

Here are some photos I took:
